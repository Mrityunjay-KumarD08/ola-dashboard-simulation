🚕 Ola Data Analytics Final Project
This project simulates and analyzes a month-long dataset of Ola ride bookings in Bengaluru. Created using synthetic data, the goal of this project is to explore booking trends, customer behavior, cancellations, and ratings using Power BI for data visualization and SQL for backend analysis. The project is designed to showcase real-world analytics skills relevant to data science and business intelligence roles.

🎯 Objective
To perform end-to-end analysis on ride-sharing data to extract business insights, understand operational patterns, and visualize trends in customer and driver behavior.

📁 Dataset
File: ola1.csv

Records: 20,000+ bookings

Source: Artificial data created using ChatGPT with realistic structure and diversity

Booking Success Rate: Approx. 62%

🗃️ Key Columns:
Booking Info: Date, Time, Booking ID, Status, Customer ID

Vehicle Details: Auto, Mini, Prime Sedan, Prime SUV, Bike, eBike, etc.

Locations: 50 dummy areas from Bangalore (Pickup & Drop)

Time Metrics: VTAT (Vehicle Time to Arrival), CTAT (Customer Time to Arrival)

Cancellations: By customer and driver, with reasons

Ride Metrics: Booking value, ride distance, ratings

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI – For interactive dashboards and visual storytelling

SQL – For data querying and preparation
